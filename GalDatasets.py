# Like ETGDatasets.py but need the following functions:
# Read all properties
# Read particular properties in a list/keyword and for particular galaxies
# Read properties in different forms (for now just do the continuous
# list KS relation form, because we need to think about how to read the
# data for spatial distribution, when galaxies are different sizes)
# In fact maybe we don't need to train with a spatial distribution,
# we can predict that just from the spatial distribution of the other
# properties...? But we need to think about the use of LR and HR to
# train and predict clumping factors.
# Remember to cut all datasets to the same size in the above!
